Let's assume that we want generate samples from a multivariate normal distribution. 

First we assume we know how to generate samples from a univariate gaussian distribution.

So we have n independent random variables $x_1, x_2,..., x_n$

We can easily generate samples from a univariate normal distribution using:

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
