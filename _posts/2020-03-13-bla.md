title: Correlating random numbers

Let's assume that we want generate samples from a multivariate normal distribution. 

First we assume we know how to generate samples from a univariate gaussian distribution.

So we have n independent random variables $x_1, x_2,..., x_n$ where $x_i \sim \mathcal{N(0,1)}$

$\langle \vec{x} \rangle =0$ and $\langle \vec{x}\vec{x}^T \rangle = \mathbb{1}$.

and what we aim to find is a linear mapping $M: x \mapsto y$. 

Where the new variable $y$ has a covariance matrix $C$ which we can specify as we wish.




We can easily generate samples from a univariate normal distribution using:

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
