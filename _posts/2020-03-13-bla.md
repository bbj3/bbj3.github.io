title: Correlating random numbers

Let's assume that we want generate samples from a multivariate normal distribution. 

First we assume we know how to generate samples from a univariate gaussian distribution.

So we have n independent random variables $x_1, x_2,..., x_n$ where $x_i \sim \mathcal{N(0,1)}$

$\langle \vec{x} \rangle =0$ and $\langle \vec{x} \vec{x}^T \rangle = \mathbb{1}$.

and what we aim to find is a linear mapping $M: \vec{x} \mapsto \vec{y}$. 

Where the new variable $y$ has a covariance matrix $C$, where $C=\langle \vec{y}  \vec{y}^T\rangle$ which we can specify as we wish.
 
So we want to find a transformation matrix $M$ where $M \vec{x} = \vec{y}$.

$C = \langle \vec{y}  \vec{y}^T\rangle = \langle M \vec{x}  (M \vec{x})^T\rangle = \langle M \vec{x}  \vec{x}^T M^T\rangle$






We can easily generate samples from a univariate normal distribution using:

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
